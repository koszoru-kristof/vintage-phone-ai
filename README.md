# Upcycled Vintage Telephone Project

This project aims to repurpose an old rotary dial telephone to be a more natural, non-intrusive and stylish interface to the digital world. Microphone is mechanically disconnected if handset is not in use.



## Dream use cases
### Smart home control

Pick up the phone-> Say turn off all the lights -> Hang up phone while smiling -> (light are turning off)

### Voice Assistant

Ask any random question you desperately want the answer -> it tells you the answer-> deep exhale

Ask about the temperature outside -> it tells you that it is X degrees -> happiness
